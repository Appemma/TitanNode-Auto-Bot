## ✨ Features

- **Full Automation**: Just run it, and the bot will handle the rest.
- **Token Management**: Automatically refreshes the access token to keep the session active.
- **Proxy Support**: Run multiple bots simultaneously using a proxy list from `proxies.txt`.
- **Direct Mode**: If no proxies are provided, the bot will run using your main internet connection.
- **Secure**: Safely stores your refresh token in a `.env` file.
- **Random User-Agent**: Uses a random user-agent for each connection to appear more natural.
